The main driver code for the software is located in the main method of asl.py

To achieve the different uses you must edit the specific function calls within the main method

The dataset as well as the trained models are zipped, they must be unzipped to a folder with the same name for the code to function

The preprocessed data set files are not included due to large file size, you must edit the appropriate functions to preprocess any data. These are found in asl.py (load_train)

Please email me at acengiz@ryerson.ca if you have any issues running the code
